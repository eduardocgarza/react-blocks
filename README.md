# Reusable React Code Blocks

## Overview

Iâ€™m creating a series of software blog posts on React - specifically on creating reusable code modules that are stable and can be reused across projects for common functions in front-end web applications. This repository serves as an overview for the subsequent blog posts, each covering the following code blocks:

2. Styling and Components
3. Routing and Navigation
4. Authentication and Authorization
5. Forms and Validation
6. HTTP Client and Requests to APIs
7. App State
8. Offline State
9. Logging
10. Analytics and SEO
11. Web Sockets
12. File Upload and Download

Each blog post is written in a rigorously technical manner, focusing entirely on the technical content with no filler words. The posts are extensive and thorough, akin to a scientific paper or journal, covering the most common libraries, resources, and tools to achieve the given code block, with comparisons and practical examples in both plain English and code.
